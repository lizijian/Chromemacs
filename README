I'm not the original author, I just got the source code from github and made some
essential change. Please refer to :
    https://github.com/paradoxxxzero/chrome-emacs-mode
    https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/miojjimhedbpnnjpneobbfhdicckhhkd?hl=en_US
    https://github.com/5p/Emacs-mode

And my purpose is that I need a Firemacs like bindings on chrome, because I am 
accustomed to options of Firemacs.

This is my 1st time to write a chrome extension, a web application, a java script.
I don't familiar with JS/CSS/WEB before.So if you have some great ideas or suggests
about this extension, please feel free to send me a email.
